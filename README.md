PeterAlert as its fully known as was my first coding project I did in my free time. With no knowledge of programming for release, there was a learning curve in navigating Visual Studio's GUI. In its current state, Peter.exe is a C program that provides popup of Peter Griffin with only one option. Peter serves a purpose as a cybersecurity student. At my disposal are many tools used for injection, so testing them with a benign program that provides me with feedback is useful and hilarious. Enjoy peter alert :)
